djcorecap
=========

Core app for Django projects that provides essential functions, tags, and enhanced Bootstrap-friendly templates.

* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

* Custom base template that plays nicely with Bootstrap (and themes like startbootstrap)
* Custom allauth templates that play nicely with Bootstrap (and themes like startbootstrap)
* Convenience functions to support Bokeh plots
* Template tag for auto-setting links to active


Installation
------------

Add djcorecap.apps.DjCorecapConfig to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.  
Ensure that it comes before all other third party apps to enable 
template overrides, etc.  

If you plan to use the app's base template 
as your project's base template, replace base.html in 
project/templates/ with a file containing the following:

{% extends "djcorecap/base.html" %}

If you plan to use djcorecap's version of the allauth templates, delete 
the account/ folder (if exists) from project/templates/.

djcorecap
=========

Useful Django templates, helper functions, and etc.

Installation
------------

Add djcorecap.apps.DjCorecapConfig to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.  
Ensure that it comes before all other third party apps to enable 
template overrides, etc.  

If you plan to use the app's base template 
as your project's base template, replace base.html in 
project/templates/ with a file containing the following:

{% extends "djcorecap/base.html" %}

If you plan to use djcorecap's version of the allauth templates, delete 
the account/ folder (if exists) from project/templates/.
